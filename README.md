## 💡 Overview

After going through a lengthy job-hunting process, I realized I couldn’t keep a routine alone.
So I built habitConnect, a simple habit builder for job seekers.

What makes it different is the social layer — you can share your LinkedIn and Notion profiles to collaborate, compare routines, and keep each other accountable.

This idea was inspired by my experience in the Formation Fellowship (since 2023), where pair sessions and peer support helped me far more than grinding alone.

## ✨ Key Features

🎯 Up to 8 habits to keep your week focused

📈 Clean statistics to visualize your progress at a glance

⏸️ Break feature — because rest is part of the process

🤝 Opt-in Social Layer — share your LinkedIn + Notion to find partners and compare routines

🔒 Privacy by default — only those who share can access the social page

🛡️ OAuth2 sign-in for secure authentication

## 🎯 Mission

My goal is to help job seekers stay consistent, reduce mental load, and build momentum together.
If you’re job hunting, give it a try, it’s free. I’d love your feedback!
